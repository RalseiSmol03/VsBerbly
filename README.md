## This port changed some stuff like:
* Removed Unnecessary Options(Including Not Mobile Controls)
* Better Settings Defaults
* Faster Loading than any Berdly Ports
* Removed Useless Stuff(like Mods)

## Note and Warnings:
* Precaching is **ENABLED** by default. You can change it on Options if you don't want it.
* **Hitbox** is only controller on Song Start, because of latest Android Controls(removed VPAD Support)(I'll try to restore it)
* Using Precaching needs at least **4GB RAM**, recommended is **6GB RAM**. Using low-end devies/low ram devices will freeze or lag the game.
* Tell me if there's bug or something wrong in the port.
